As an Node Data Manager, you will have the key responsibility to uphold your Network's Data Privacy Policy. You have access to private datasets that not even your direct supervisors will have access to. 

For this reason, you need to be **intimately** familiar with the types of data which are under embargo/private, and what is publicly available for your Network. You will need to develop an internal protocol for when requests for data access are submitted, to ensure appropriate care is taken to protect the integrity of your members' data.

OTN recommends creating a "Data Request Response Policy".


## External Requests

This is an example of how OTN handles these requests:

1. Request for data (from person other than data owner) submitted
2. Data request is scoped, in a Gitlab Issue. All details from requester is included.
3. Impacted PIs are identified, and contacted, seeking written permission for requester to access the information.
4. Written permission is documented in Gitlab Issue, to preserve the paper-trail.
5. Data request report is compiled and provided to requester, once all permissions have been received.


## Internal Requests

Internal requests, from other Network staff, need to be handled in a similar way. While all Network staff should be familiar with the Data Policy, this may not be the case. It is the Node Manager's responsibility to ensure that information from the database is not shared outside of internal reports. We need to track requests from all sources, this includes the Glider and Field teams too, so we can have a record of who knows what, and be able to remind them of our policies officially.


## Partner-Node Data Policies

It's important to remember that the Data Policy of the Network which holds the **tag records** will apply to the detections of those tags, in other Nodes. You cannot share information/detections of tags from outside your Node, without first consulting with your partner's Data Policy. This will likely not be an issue for most Nodes, but is a key consideration for OTN staff when creating data products.

For guidance on the interpretation of your Data Policy, or the Data Policy of a parter Node, OTN's Director of Data Operations is available to assist.
