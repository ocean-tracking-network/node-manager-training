---

The **first** step when you are contacted by a researcher who wants to register their project with the Database is to request Project Metadata. For most Nodes, this is in the form of a plaintext `.txt` file, using the template provided [here](https://members.oceantrack.org/data/data-collection). This file allows the researcher to provide information on the core attributes of the project, including the scientific abstract, associated investigators, geospatial details, temporal and taxonomic range.

# Completed Metadata

Immediately, upon receipt of the metadata, a new Gitlab Issue should be created. Please use the `Project Metadata` Issue checklist template.

Here is the Issue checklist, for reference:

```
Project Metadata
- [ ] - NAME add label *'loading records'*
- [ ] - NAME define type of project  **select here one of Data, Deployment, Tracker**
- [ ] - NAME create schema and project records (`Creating and Updating project metadata` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME add project contact information (`Creating and Updating project metadata` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME add scientificnames (`Creating and Updating project metadata` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME [OTN only] manually identify if this is a loan, if so add record to otnunit obis.loan_tracking (`Creating and Updating project metadata` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME verify all of above (`Creating and Updating project metadata` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME [OTN only] create new project repo users (`Create Plone Folders and Add Users` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME [OTN only] create project repo folder (`Create Plone Folders and Add Users` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME [OTN only] add project repo users to folder (`Create Plone Folders and Add Users` notebook)
- [ ] - NAME [OTN only] access project repo double-check project repository creation and user access 
- [ ] - NAME add project metadata file to project folder (OTN members.oceantrack.org, FACT RW etc)
- [ ] - NAME send onboarding email to PIs
- [ ] - NAME [OTN only] if this is a loan, update links for PMO
- [ ] - NAME label issue with *'Verify'*
- [ ] - NAME pass issue to analyst for final verification
- [ ] - NAME verify project in database

**project metadata txt file**
```

### Visual Inspection

Once the completed file is received from a researcher, the Data Manager should complete a visual check for formatting and accuracy.

Things to check:

1. Is the PI-provided collection code unique/appropriate? Do you need to create one yourself? Existing schemas/collection codes can be seen in the database
1. Are there typos in the title or abstract?
1. Are the contacts formatted correctly?
1. Are the species formatted correctly?
1. Does the location make sense based on the abstract, and is it formatted correctly (one per line)?

In general, most commonly formatting errors occur in the `Contacts` section. Pay close attention here.

Below is an example of a properly completed metadata form, for your reference.

```
===FORM START===
0. Intended/preferred project code, if known? (May be altered by OTNDC)
format: XXXX (3-6 uppercase letters that do not already have a representation in the OTN DB. Will be assigned if left blank)

NSBS

1. Title-style description of the project?
format:  < 70 words in 'paper title' form

OTN NS Blue Shark Tracking

2. Brief abstract of the project? 
format: < 500 words in 'abstract' form

In the Northwest Atlantic, the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), in collaboration with Dalhousie University, is using an acoustic telemetry infrastructure to monitor the habitat use, movements, and survival of juvenile blue sharks (Prionace glauca). This infrastructure includes state-of-the-art acoustic receivers and oceanographic monitoring equipment, and autonomous marine vehicles carrying oceanographic sensors and mobile acoustic receivers. Long-life acoustic tags (n=40) implanted in the experimental animals will provide long-term spatial resolution of shark movements and distribution, trans-boundary migrations, site fidelity, and the speciesâ€™ response to a changing ocean. This study will facilitate interspecific comparisons, documentation of intra- and interspecific interactions, and permit long-term monitoring of this understudied predator in the Northwest Atlantic. The study will also provide basic and necessary information to better inform fisheries managers and policy makers. This is pertinent given the recent formulation of the Canadian Plan of Action for Shark Conservation.

3. Names, affiliations, email addresses, and ORCID (if available) of researchers involved in the project and their role. 

The accepted Project Roles are defined as:
Principal Investigator: PI or Co-PI. The person(s) responsible for the overall planning, direction and management of the project.
Technician: Person(s) responsible for preparation, operation and/or maintenance of shipboard, laboratory or deployed scientific instrumentation, but has no invested interest in the data returned by that instrumentation.
Researcher: Person(s) who may use/analyse the data to answer research questions, but is not the project lead. Can be a student if their involvement spans past the completion of an academic degree. 
Student: Person(s) researching as part of a project as part of their work towards an academic degree. 
Collaborator: A provider of input/support to a project without formal involvement in the project.

Please add 'Point of Contact' to the contact(s) who will be responsible for communicating with OTN. 

format: Firstname Lastname, Employer OR Affiliation, Project Role (choose from above list), email.address@url.com, point of contact (if relevant), ORCID

Fred Whoriskey, OTN, principal investigator, fwhoriskey@dal.ca,  0000-0001-7024-3284
Sara Iverson, OTN, principal investigator, sara.iverson@dal.ca
Caitlin Bate, Dal, researcher, caitlin.bate@dal.ca, point of contact


4. Project URL - can be left blank

https://members.oceantrack.org/

5. Species being studied?  
format: Common name (scientific name)

Blue shark (Prionace glauca)
Sunfish (Mola mola)

6. Location of the project? 
format: (city, state/province OR nearby landmark OR lat/long points in decimal degree), one per line

Halifax, NS
44.19939/-63.24085 

7. Start and end dates of the project, if known? 
format: YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD ('ongoing' is an acceptable end date)

```

# Quality Control - Create and Update Projects

Each step in the Issue checklist will be discussed here, along with other important notes required to use the Nodebooks.

### Imports cell

This section will be common for most Nodebooks: it is a cell at the top of the notebook where you will import any required packages and functions to use throughout the notebook. It must be run first, every time. 

You will have to edit one section: `engine = get_engine()` 
- Within the open brackets you need to open quotations and paste the path to your database `.kdbx` file which contains your login credentials.
- On MacOS computers, you can usually find and copy the path to your database `.kdbx` file by right-clicking on the file and holding down the "option" key. On Windows, we recommend using the installed software Path Copy Copy, so you can copy a unix-style path by right-clicking.
- The path should look like `engine = get_engine('C:/Users/username/Desktop/Auth files/database_conn_string.kdbx')`. 

### Project Metadata Parser

This cell is where you input the information contained in the Project Metadata `.txt` file. There are two ways to do this:

1. You can paste in the filepath to the saved `.txt`. You should ensure the formatting is correct before doing so.
1. You can paste the entire contents of the file, from `===FORM START=== to ===FORM END===` inclusive, into the provided quotation marks.

Once either option is selected, you can run the cell to complete the quality control checks.

The output will have useful information:
- Are there strange characters in the collectioncode, project title, or abstract?
- Were the names and affiliations of each contact successfully parsed? Are there any affiliated institutions which are not found? Are there any contacts which were not found that you expected to be?
- Is the project URL formatted correctly?
- Are all the species studies found in WoRMS? Are any of them non-accepted taxonomy (look at top of each species-record for success: `INFO: Halichoerus grypus is an accepted taxon, and has Aphia ID 137080.`, followed by a URL)? Which ones have common names which are **not** matching the WoRMS records (look at bottom of each species record for success: `OK: Grey seal is an acceptable vernacular name for Halichoerus grypus`)? **NOTE: any mismatches with commonname can be fixed at a later stage, make a note in the Issue for your records**
- Is the suggested Bounding Box appropriate based on the abstract? **NOTE: any issues with the scale of the bounding box can be fixed at a later stage, make a note in the Issue for your records**
- Are the start and end dates formatted correctly?

Generally, most of the error messages arise from the **Contacts** and **Species** sections.

If there is information which is not parsing correctly, you should fix the source-file and re-run the cell until you are happy with the output.

### Manual Fields - Dropdown Menu

There are some fields which need to be setup by the Data Manager, and not set by the researcher. These are in the next cell.

You will run this cell, and a fillable form will appear.

1. Node: select your node
1. Collaboration Type: based on the abstract, are they deploying only tags (`Tracker` project), only receivers (`Deployment` project) or both tags and receivers (`Data` project)? 
1. Ocean: choose the most appropriate ocean region based on the abstract.
1. Shortname: use the Title provided by the researcher, or something else, which will be used as the name of the Data Portal folder. ex: `OTN Blue Sharks`.
1. Longname: use the Title provided by the researcher, or something else, which is in "scientific-paper" style. ex: `Understanding the movements of Blue sharks through Nova Scotia waters, using acoustic telemetry.`
1. Series Code: this will generally be the name of your node. Compare to values found in the database `obis.otn_resources` if youâ€™re unsure.
1. Institution Code: The main institution responsible for maintaining the project. Compare to values found in the database `obis.institution_codes` and `obis.otn_resources` if youâ€™re unsure. **If this is a new Institution, please make a note in the Issue, so you can add it later on**
1. Country: based upon the abstract. Multiple countries can be listed as such: `CANADA, USA, EGYPT` etc.
1. State: based upon the abstract. Multiple countries can be listed as such: `NOVA SCOTIA, NEWFOUNDLAND` etc.
1. Local Area: based upon the abstract. Finer-scale of location. ex: `Halifax`
1. Locality: based upon the abstract. Finest-scale of location. ex: `Shubenacadie River`
1. Status: is the project completed, ongoing or something else?

To save and parse your inputted values **DO NOT** re-run the cell - this will clear all your input. Instead, the next cell is the one which needs to be run to parse the information.

Verify the output from the parser cell, looking for several things:
1. Are all the fields marked with a green `OK`?
1. Is this feedback included in the institution code section: ie `Found institution record for DFO in your database:` followed by a small, embedded Table.

If anything is wrong, please begin again from the Manual Field input cell.

If the institution code **IS NOT** found - compare to values found in the database `obis.institution_codes` and `obis.otn_resources`. **If this is a new Institution, please make a note in the Issue, so you can add it later on**

#### Task list checkpoint

In Gitlab, this task can be completed at this stage:

`- [ ] - NAME define type of project  **select here one of Data, Deployment, Tracker**`

Please edit to include the selected project type, in harmony with the selected field in the notebook.

### Verifying Correct Info

At this stage, we have all the information parsed that we need in order to register the project in the database. There is now a cell that will print out every saved value for your review.

You are looking for:
- Typos
- Strange characters
- Correct information based on abstract

If this information is satisfactory, you can proceed.

#### Adjust Bounding Box

The cell titled `Verify the new project details before writing to the DB` is the final step for verification before the values are written to the database. At this stage a map will appear, with the proposed Bounding Box for the project.

Based on the abstract, you can use the `Square Draw Tool` to re-draw the bounding box until you are happy with it. Once you are happy, you can run the *following* cell in order to save your bounding adjustments. The output should be formatted like this:

```
--- Midpoint ---
Latitude:
Longitude: 
```

### Create New Institution

Remember above, where we noted whether or not an institution existed on `obis.institution_codes` or if it was a new institution? This cell is our opportunity to add any institutions if they are new. If all institutions (for each contact, plus for the project as a whole) exist, then you can skip this cell.

To run the cell, you will need to complete:
1. a short-code for the institution (ex: DAL)
1. the institution's website (ex: https://www.dal.ca/)
1. the full institution name (ex: Dalhousie University)

Once all values are completed, run the cell and confirm the following output:

```
Institution record 'DAL' created.
```

You can re-run this cell as many times as you need, to add each missing institution.

### Write Project to the Database

Finally, it is time to write the project records to the database and create the new project!

First, you should run this cell with `printSQL = True`. If there are no errors, you can edit and change to `printSQL = False` and run again. This will register the project! 

You will see some output - confirm each line is accompanied by a green `OK`.

#### Task list checkpoint

In Gitlab, this task can be completed at this stage:

`- [ ] - NAME create schema and project records ("Creating and Updating project metadata" notebook)`

### Save Contact Information

At this stage, the next step is to add contact information for all identified collaborators.

This cell will gather and print out all contacts and their information. Review for errors. If none exist, move to the next cell.

First, you should run this cell with `printSQL = True`. If there are no errors, you can edit and change to `printSQL = False` and run again. This will add each contact to the database, into the `obis.contacts` and `obis.contacts_projects` tables.

There should be output similar to this:

```
Valid contact:  Fred Whoriskey OTN principalInvestigator fwhoriskey@dal.ca
```

#### Task list checkpoint

In Gitlab, this task can be completed at this stage:

`- [ ] - NAME add project contact information ("Creating and Updating project metadata" notebook)`

### Add Species Information

The following section will allow you to add the required information into the `obis.scientific_names` table.

The first cell imports the required function.

The second cell, when run, will create an editable input form for each animal.

You should review to confirm the following:
1. the scientific name is matching to an accepted WoRMS taxon. There should be a URL provided, and no error messages.
1. the common name is acceptable. If it is not, you can choose a value from the dropdown menu (taken directly from WoRMS' `vernacular` list) **OR** you can enter a custom value to match the common name provided by the researcher.

Once you are sure that both the scientific and common names are correct, based on the information provided by both the project and the notebook, you may click the `Add to project` button for each animal record you'd like to insert.

There will be a confirmation display in the notebook to demonstrate if the insertion was successful.

#### Task list checkpoint

In Gitlab, this task can be completed at this stage:

`- [ ] - NAME add scientificnames ("Creating and Updating project metadata" notebook)`

### OPTIONAL: Add Project Loan Information

The following section is used by OTN staff to track projects which are recipients of OTN-equipment loans. This section is not within the scope of this Node Manager Training, because it requires a login-file for the `otnunit` database.

### Skip to Verification

Once you scroll past the `Project Loan Information` section, you will see a yellow star and the words **Skip to the new project Verification**. You should click the button provided, which will help you scroll to the bottom of the notebook, where the `Verify` section is located.

This is a chance to visually review all the fields you just entered. You should enter run these cells and review all output to ensure the database values align with the intended insertions.

#### Task list checkpoint

In Gitlab, this task can be completed at this stage:

`- [ ] - NAME verify all of above ("Creating and Updating project metadata" notebook)`

### Other Features of this Notebook

There are more features in the `Create and Update Projects` notebook than those covered above.

#### Schema extension

This section is to be used when you have a project which is either `Tracker` or `Deployment` and is expanding to become a `Data` project. Ex: a project which was only tagging has begun deploying receivers.

You can use this notebook to create the missing tables for the schema. Ex: the above example would need `stations`, `rcvr_locations`, and `moorings` tables created.

#### Schema updating 

This section is to be used to change the values contained in `obis.otn_resources`. The first cell will open an editable form with the existing database values. You can change the required fields (ex: abstract).

To save and parse your inputted values **DO NOT** re-run the cell - this will clear all your input. Instead, the next cell is the one which needs to be run to parse the information.

Review the output and check for typos. 

The next cell will show the changes that will be made to the project data. You can copy this output and paste it into the relevant Gitlab Issue for tracking.

The final cell will make the desired changes in the database. Ensure `printSQL = False` if you want the cell to execute directly.

The output should look like this to confirm success:

```
'Resource record for HFX has been updated.'
```

# Final Steps

The remaining steps in the Gitlab Checklist are completed outside the notebooks.

First: you should access the created Repository folder in your browser and confirm if the title and sharing information is correct. If so, add the project metadata `.txt` file into the "Data and Metadata" folder.

Next, you should send an email to the project contacts letting them know their project code and other onboarding information.

Finally, the Issue can be passed off to an OTN-analyst for final verification in the database.
